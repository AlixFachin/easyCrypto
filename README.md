# Summary 😎
This repository contains a code project I realized during my time at [Code Chrysalis](https://www.codechrysalis.io). <br>
This project aims to demistify the RSA algorithm, or the idea of Public Key/Private Key concepts. 
In actual usage, for obvious security reasons, the numbers used are huge and as a result it is difficult to understand how things work.<br>
I tried to implement by myself the RSA algorithm with small numbers, to try to understand how the model works below the hood.

# Deployment 💾
This page is accessible on Github pages at the following address:

# How to install 💻
* The package uses `npm` package manager.
* Download or clone the repository
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run start` to start the development server. You should be able to see the page with any browser on your `localhost:3000` address.

# How to use the webpage 🤔
The page has two distinct parts:
* 🗝 **Key Generator**: to try to understand what is the principle used to find public and private keys.
* 🥷**Encoding/Decoding**: Once we have a public key/private key, we can put it in practice and encode/decode any message. (Without emojis, please.)

# Description of the algorithm 🧑‍🔬
## General considerations
A public key will in our case be a couple of integers `(a,b)`. <br>
The private key is constitued of another integer `p`, which, associated with the second key `b`  makes the private key `(p,b)`.

## Coding and Encoding 📝
* We will transform characters into number, so we can assume that we want to transmit a sequence of numbers.
* In order to encode a character of code `c`, we take `c` to the power `a`.
  * The encoded character code will be the remainder of `c^a` by `b`, so `(c^a mod b)`.
* In order to decode an encoded character, we can take the encoded character `e` and proceed with a similar operation, but this time with the private key `p`, i.e. `e^p mod b`.
* If we choose `a`,`b` and `p` wisely, we can assure that `(c^a mod b)^p mod b = c` so we have decoded the message.

## Choosing the public and private keys 🔑
* As mentioned above, we need to choose `a`, `b` and `p` wisely, so that the operation works, but as well so that it is very difficult for anyone else to figure out `p` (the private key) while knowing `a` and `b` (which are public).
* Prime numbers have very interesting properties, and combining prime numbers with circular arithmetics ends up with such result.

# Technologies used 🆙
* Using <https://reactjs.org> for front-end component and state management
* This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
* Using [JSBI](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/jsbi) for management of [BigInt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt), necessary for mathematical computations but impossible to transpile for backward compatibility.
